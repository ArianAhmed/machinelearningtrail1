Trains a multilayer perceptron neural network with two hidden layers. Weights are initialised using xavier weight initialisation. Best run obtained 95.11% accuracy with just one epoch. Standard training dataset used from mnist, and standard testing dataset used from mnist. Results file also show the accuracy per number as well as the total accuracy. Activation function used is the sigmoid (1/(1+exp(-x))) for all layers. Stochastic gradient descent used at each data, using standard backpropagation (optimised derivative calculations). Running time is 750 seconds approximately. Coded in C++ , issues in visual studios so codeblocks has been used.
